# JogTracker
for Yellow

MVVM was chosen as architecture pattern. Application is quite simple and includes: views, networking, data for view setup, also MVVM is close to MVC, that I have enough expirience in. 

All the main and optional part of the task was completed. Please check the result in the dev branch.

Thank you!
