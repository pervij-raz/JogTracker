# JogTracker
for Yellow

MVVM was chosen as architecture pattern. Application is quite simple and includes: views, networking, data for view setup, also MVVM is close to MVC, in what I have enough expirience. 

All the main and optional part of the task was completed, but weekly report has bugs with the dates, maybe it will be fixed in the nearest future. Also report preparing is using too much time and memory. From my point of view such a task should be implemented on the backend side, but maybe I just don't know about necessary framework existing. I would be grateful for the advice here, please.

Please check the result in the dev branch.

Thank you!
